	- There should be at least one comment at the begginning of each script detailing what variable names mean (EXAMPLE: _dt means derivative of, _max means max of etc...)
	- NO one letter variables shall be used, try to make them understandable as to what they are. (EXAMPLE: "Vel" instead of "V" for velocity)
	- Naming convention throughout similar code shall be kept throughout the code. If you notice someone else is using a different name for the same thing, discuss and pick one

3. All commits and merges shall have a type and appropriate commit message detailing all the changes
	- Any commit message shall contain one of the following when entered:
		"bug:..." says this commit was used to fix a bug
