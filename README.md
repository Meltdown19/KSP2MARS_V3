# KSP2MARS_V3
The third iteration of the KSP2MARS project repository for the Programming Team

This is the main folders for the project broken down into sections as follows:

Simulation: for simulations and simulation related documents that are required for our work

Launch: Scripts for GNC of launch vehicles (both Earth and Mars)

Rendezvous: For code related to ship to ship rendezvous 

Docking: For code related to ship to ship Docking and Undocking procedures

Burn Execution: Basic code for maneuver node execution and other orbital burn maneuvers

Orbital Mechanics: This might not be needed since it might fall under Astrodynamics but any code involved in solving for orbital parmameters or phenomenon

Landing: Code for entry and landing on Mars and Earth 

Utility Scripts: Things we might need for functions that happen a lot or to ease workload
